  # All CAdES signature examples converge to this action, but with different URL arguments:
  #
  # 1. Signature with a server file               : no arguments filled
  # 2. Signature with a file uploaded by the user : "userfile" filled
  # 3. Co-signature of a previously signed CMS    : "cmsfile" filled

      # If the URL argument "cmsfile" is filled, the user has asked to co-sign a previously signed CMS. We'll
      # set the path to the CMS to be co-signed
      # Note two important things:
      #
      # 1. The CMS to be co-signed must be set using one of the methods "set_cms_tocosign", not one of the
      #    methods "set_file_tosign".
      #
      # 2. Since we're creating CMSs with encapsulated content (see call to encapsulate_content below), we
      #    don't need to set the content to be signed, REST PKI will get the content from the CMS being
      #    co-signed.

    #    includes the content

    # Call the start_with_webpki method, which initiates the signature. This yields the token, a 43-character
    # case-sensitive URL-safe string, which identifies this signature process. We'll use this value to call the
    # sign_with_restpki method on the Web PKI component (see signature-form.js) and also to complete the
    # signature after the form is submitted (see method action below). This should not be mistaken with the
    # API access token.

    # The token acquired above can only be used for a single signature attempt. In order to retry the signature
    # it is necessary to get a new token. This can be a problem if the user uses the back button of the browser,
    # since the browser might show a cached page that we rendered previously, with a now stale token. To prevent
    # this from happening, we call the method set_expired_page_headers, located in application_helper.rb,
    # which sets HTTP headers to prevent caching of the page.

    # after calling the finish method.
